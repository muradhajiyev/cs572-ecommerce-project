### Installation

The easiest way to configure development environment and run the application is to use Docker. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. 

##### Docker configuration

After installing docker desktop in your machine, you just need to clone the project and go to the project folder from terminal or command prompt. 

Run the command `docker-compose up`. All containers will be run automatically. You can access angular from localhost:4200 and express from localhost:3000 and mongo from localhost:27017.

There is also an extra container mongo-seeder that helps to load seed data before run application.
